# Book Management Web Server
This comprehensive full-stack project is designed to manage books, offering a deep dive into the development process. The back-end utilizes SQLite with SQLAlchemy for efficient database management, and Flask for building a robust REST API. On the front-end, the project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, facilitating seamless interaction with the REST API and rendering data dynamically in HTML. The primary goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of full-stack development, improve my coding skills, and become more familiar with database management and web server APIs.

## Features

- Add, delete, view books
- View book categories and authors
- Borrow books
- View student information

## Project Structure

- `author_category/`: Provides API services for authors and book categories.
- `books/`: Provides API services for books.
- `borrow/`: Provides API services for borrowing books.
- `students/`: Provides API services for students.
- `unit_test/`: Contains unit test cases to test the APIs.
- `app.py`: The main file that runs the Flask server, handles requests from users, interacts with the database, and responds.

## Knowledge Gained
Through this project, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge in the following areas:

Full-stack development: Developed a web server from scratch, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies.
- Database management: Used SQLite and SQLAlchemy to manage the database for the application.
- RESTful API development: Implemented REST API endpoints using Flask to provide services for managing books, authors, categories, borrowing, and student information.
- Unit testing: Wrote unit test cases to ensure the functionality of the API services.
- Web development: Created a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the REST API.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuyAIExplorer/RestFullAPI-With-Flask.git
